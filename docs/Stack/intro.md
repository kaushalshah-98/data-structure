# Introduction to Stacks in JavaScript

## 1. Definition
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the top.

## 2. Key Characteristics
- **Last In, First Out (LIFO):** The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
- **Single Access Point:** Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.
- **Dynamic Size:** The size of the stack can change during program execution.

## 3. Operations
- **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
- **Peek (Top):** Retrieves the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty:** Checks if the stack is empty.
- **Size:** Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## 4. Implementation Considerations
- Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
- JavaScript does not have a built-in stack data structure, but arrays can be used to simulate stack behavior.

## 5. Use Cases
- Expression Evaluation (Postfix, Prefix, and Infix Notations)
- Function Call Management (Call Stack)
- Undo Mechanisms in Applications
- Browser History Management

## 6. Comparison with Other Data Structures
- **Arrays:** Stacks provide a more restricted set of operations but are more efficient for certain use cases.
- **Linked Lists:** Stacks are simpler but offer limited functionality compared to linked lists.

## 7. Common Terminology
- **Push:** Adding an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Removing the top element from the stack.
- **Peek (Top):** Retrieving the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty:** Checking if the stack is empty.
- **Size:** Count of elements in the stack.

# Conclusion
Stacks are a fundamental data structure with a variety of applications, providing an efficient way to manage data in a Last In, First Out manner. Understanding their characteristics and operations is essential for effective utilization in different programming scenarios.
