# Stack Deletion Operations (Pop) in JavaScript

## Definition
The Pop operation removes the element from the top of the stack. After the Pop operation, the top of the stack is updated, and the size of the stack decreases by one.

## Implementation
In JavaScript, you can use an array to simulate a stack. The `pop` method is used to remove the last element from the array, representing the top of the stack.

```javascript
// Initialize a stack with elements
let stack = [10, 20, 30];

// Pop an element from the stack
function popElement() {
    if (stack.length === 0) {
        console.log("Stack is empty. Cannot pop.");
        return;
    }

    return stack.pop();
}
// Example Usage
let poppedElement = popElement();
console.log("Popped element:", poppedElement);
console.log("Stack after pop operation:", stack);
```
## Explanation
Create an array (stack) and initialize it with some elements to represent the stack.
The popElement function checks if the stack is empty. If not, it uses the pop method to remove and return the last element from the array, simulating the top of the stack.
The example usage demonstrates popping an element from the stack.
## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the Pop operation using an array is typically O(1), as removing the last element from an array is a constant-time operation.

## Considerations
Check for an empty stack before performing the Pop operation to avoid errors.
Be mindful of potential underflow issues if trying to pop from an empty stack.
In a more advanced scenario, consider implementing a custom stack class for better encapsulation and control.
## Conclution
This Pop operation is fundamental for managing and manipulating a stack in JavaScript.
